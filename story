Story*
Once upon a time, in a forest, there lived a Monkey who resided on a Berry Tree, which was on the banks of a river.
In the same forest, there lived a Crocodile and his wife.
One day, the Crocodile came to the banks of the river and rested under the Tree.
The kindhearted Monkey offered him some fruits and the Crocodile gladly accepted.
The Crocodile came back the next day to eat more fruits as he loved them. 
As the days went by, the Crocodile and the Monkey became good friends.
